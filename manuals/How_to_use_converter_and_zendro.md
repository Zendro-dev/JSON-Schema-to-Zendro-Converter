# How to setup Zendro using the supported databases

### 1. Install Zendro
- Verify that you have the [project requirements](https://zendro-dev.github.io/quickstart.html#project-requirements).
- Follow the [instructions](https://zendro-dev.github.io/quickstart.html#step-1-installation) to install Zendro.

### 2. Install JSON Schema to Zendro Converter
- Follow the [instructions](https://github.com/Zendro-dev/JSON-Schema-to-Zendro-Converter?tab=readme-ov-file#installation) to install the JSON-Schema to Zendro Converter.

### 3. Use the converter in your JSON Schemas
Before using the converter on your schemas, please ensure that your models meet the necessary requirements for the converter to work. Check the details [here](https://github.com/Zendro-dev/JSON-Schema-to-Zendro-Converter?tab=readme-ov-file#json_schema_requirements).

-  General Usage:
    ```bash
    python methods/converter.py -i [input-path] -o [output-path] [other command-line arguments]
    ```

- Command-Line Arguments

    The `converter` script converts JSON schemas into Zendro data models. Below are the available arguments:

    #### Required Arguments

    - `-i, --input-path`  
    **Description:** Path to the JSON schemas.  

    - `-o, --output-path`  
    **Description:** Path where the Zendro data models should be stored.  

    #### Optional Arguments

    - `-s, --storage-type`  
    **Description:** Type of storage where the model is stored.  
    **Choices:**  
        - `sql` (default)  
        - `generic`  
        - `zendro-server`  
        - `cassandra`  
        - `mongodb`  
        - `neo4j`  
        - `presto/trino`  
        - `amazon-s3`  
        - `distributed-data-model`  
        - `adapter`  

    - `-p, --primary-key-name`  
    **Description:** Name of the primary key.  

    - `-t, --primary-key-type`  
    **Description:** Type of the primary key.  
    **Choices:**  
        - `Int`  
        - `String` (default)  

    - `-d, --database-mapping`  
    **Description:** Mapping of models to specific databases.  
    **Format:** `"sql=model_1,model_2;mongodb=model_3"`  
    **Note:** Models not listed here will use the storage type set by `-s`.  

### 4. Create Zendro instance

- Once you have your Zendro data models, you can set up Zendro. Go out from the previusly created zendro directory and create a new Zendro instance

    ```
    zendro new -d <project_name>
    ```
- If you want to use the Graphical User Interface edit the following config files to add your expected secret word in the `NEXTAUTH_SECRET` variable.
    - GraphiQL in development mode: `./graphiql-auth/.env.development `
    - GraphiQL in production mode: `./graphiql-auth/.env.production `
    - SPA in development mode: `./single-page-app/.env.development `
    - SPA in production mode: `./single-page-app/.env.production `

    If not, please edit only the GraphiQL files and comment the `zendro-spa` service in `./docker-compose-dev.yml` and `./docker-compose-prod.yml`.

    _Note: If you wish to know more about enviroment variables you can check [this](https://zendro-dev.github.io/setup_root/env_var)._

### 5. Add models 
Add your previusly converted models to `./data_model_definitions` folder.
### 6. Configure the database

You can find the database configuration example in `./config/data_models_storage_config_example.json`

Depending on the database you want to work with, you can copy the configuration from the example file and replace it in `./config/data_models_storage_config.json`. Additionally, you need to add the service to the Docker Compose configuration.

You can find the service configurations example in `./docker-compose-dev-example.yml`, and you should add them to the development and production Docker Compose files as needed.

For example, if we want to work with MongoDB, the `data_models_storage_config.json` file should contain:

```
{
    "default-mongodb": {
    "storageType": "mongodb",
    "username": "sciencedb",
    "password": "sciencedb",
    "database": "sciencedb_development",
    "host": "zendro-mongodb",
    "port": "27017"
    }
}
```

Whereas the docker-compose-prod.yml file should include the services (as applicable):

* zendro-keycloak-postgres
* zendro-keycloak
* zendro-mongodb
* zendro-graphql-server
* zendro-spa
* zendro-graphiql

_Note: If you are going to work with Cassandra, please keep in mind [these limitations](https://zendro-dev.github.io/setup_root/data_models/cassandra#cassandra-storage-type)._

### 7. Generate migrations

After setting up your data models use the next command to generate the model-specific code and fill your Zendro skeleton project with life.

Inside the new project execute:
```
zendro generate -m
```
This will automatically generate all basic create, read, update and delete (CRUD) operations for each data model specified in the scheme from the previous step.

Also, this will create migration files. By default, every migration file has two functions, namely up and down. The up function creates a table, the down function deletes the existing table. Additionally, up and down functions would add and drop indices for primary keys. Furthermore it is possible to customize the migration functions. 

Please check [this](https://zendro-dev.github.io/zendro_cli.html) to learn more about migrations.

In case you want to connect Zendro to an already existing database, please check [this](https://zendro-dev.github.io/setup_root.html#step-6-optional-define-your-database-connection) for details. 

### 8. Start Zendro

Execute this command to start Zendro in production mode or without `-p` to start in development mode.
```
$ zendro dockerize -u -p
```
This command will create docker containers for each Zendro component:

* Keycloak: manage users and roles
* API: CRUD API that can be accessed through a GraphQL query language
* GraphiQL interface: An implementation of the GraphQL IDE with Zendro login and advanced filter functionalities.
* Single Page App (SPA): graphical interface to send CRUD requests to a Zendro GraphQL endpoint (if applicable).

We recommend to check [this guide](https://zendro-dev.github.io/setup_root.html#getting-started) to fully understand the Zendro configuration and ensure you donâ€™t miss any details.

### 9. Find migration to setup your database 

In the `./graphql-server/migrations/` folder, you'll find the migration files that sets up each model. If you choose not to use Zendro, you can still use the migrations to generate the complete GraphQL schema and set up the database.

To generate and execute a specific migration, ensure that your database is accessible. You can do this starting Zendro only with the database service. Modify `./docker-compose-dev.yml` or `./docker-compose-prod.yml` as needed.

Then, navigate to the `./graphql-server/` directory and execute:

```
node utils/run_migrations.js <path_to_migration_model> up
```

### 10. Find migration to generate the complete GraphQL schema

There is a migration in the `migrations` folder named `2025-02-23T17_37_17.804Z#schema_to_text_file.js`, which generates a GraphQL file with the complete schema created by Zendro. You can execute it in the same way as the previous migrations:

```
node utils/run_migrations.js migrations/2025-02-23T17_37_17.804Z#schema_to_text_file.js up
```

This migration will generate a file named `schema.graphql` in the `graphql-server/` directory.

### 11. Technologies that do not come with a schema creation and can be used just with the configs

### 12. Mix different databases for different data models
