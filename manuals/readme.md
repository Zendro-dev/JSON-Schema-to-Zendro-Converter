# Guides for Using Zendro and the JSON Schema to Zendro Converter Tool

## Zendro

**[Zendro](https://zendro-dev.github.io/)** is a tool for quickly creating a customized data warehouse. Define data models and their storage location, and Zendro automatically generates two standardized interfaces: an efficient GraphQL API and an intuitive SPA based on Material Design. The API allows connections from any programming language or data analysis pipeline via HTTP requests. Additionally, Zendro enables data distribution across multiple databases without losing relationships between records.

### Supported Databases
Zendro is compatible with the following databases:

- **Relational databases** (SQLite, PostgreSQL)
- **Document-based databases** (MongoDB)
- **Graph-based databases** (Neo4J)
- **Wide column stores** (Cassandra)
- **Data lakes (read-only)** (Presto, Trino)
- **Comma-separated value (CSV) tables in cloud storage** (Amazon S3)

These options provide flexibility in choosing the right database based on project requirements.

## JSON Schema to Zendro Converter

The [**JSON-Schema to Zendro Converter**](https://github.com/Zendro-dev/JSON-Schema-to-Zendro-Converter) automatically transforms data-models schema defined in JSON-Schema into Zendro definition files (Zendro code generator input files). This allows users to leverage JSON-Schema to seamlessly generate a fully functional GraphQL server with complete [CRUD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Create,_read,_update_and_delete) support, distributed (cloud) deployment capabilities, full [OAuth2-compliant](https://oauth.net/2/) authentication and authorization, and an optional administrative graphical user interface.  

This converter and manuals are designed to work with any JSON Schema that adheres to the necessary requirements. While the development and testing of this tool were conducted using BrAPI as a reference, its functionality extends to any compatible JSON Schema.

### User guides

In this guides, we demonstrate how to use the converter with a practical example based on BrAPI. However, the same approach applies to any JSON Schema that meets the [prerequisites](https://github.com/Zendro-dev/JSON-Schema-to-Zendro-Converter?tab=readme-ov-file#json-schema-requirements).

Additionally, this section provides instructions on setting up a zendro instance using the listed databases for any JSON Schema.

- [User Guide](https://github.com/Zendro-dev/JSON-Schema-to-Zendro-Converter/blob/main/manuals/How_to_use_converter_and_zendro.md#how-to-setup-zendro-using-the-supported-databases): Step-by-step instructions from installing Zendro and the converter to processing models and deploying a Zendro instance.

- [User Guide](https://github.com/Zendro-dev/JSON-Schema-to-Zendro-Converter/blob/main/manuals/How_to_use_converter_and_zendro.md#9-find-migration-to-setup-your-database) to generate the database setup in case you do not want to use Zendro.

### BrAPI model examples

In [brapi_input_example](https://github.com/Zendro-dev/JSON-Schema-to-Zendro-Converter/tree/main/brapi_input_example), [results_bd](https://github.com/Zendro-dev/JSON-Schema-to-Zendro-Converter/tree/main/results_bd) and [results_distributed](https://github.com/Zendro-dev/JSON-Schema-to-Zendro-Converter/tree/main/results_distributed) directories, you can find the examples from the user guides, as well as the results generated by the JSON Schema to Zendro converter.

## BrAPI Data Warehouse  

In the **[brapi_data_warehouse](https://github.com/Zendro-dev/brapi_data_warehouse)** repository, we demonstrate how Zendro can be used to quickly set up a fully BrApi compliant data warehouse with multi Omics data. 

You will find the following folders:  

- **brapi_with_models**  
- **brapi_without_models**  

These already contain everything you need to set up a Zendro instance using the BrAPI V2.1 schema.  

For more details, please visit [this repository](https://github.com/Zendro-dev/brapi_data_warehouse).


## Where can I see an example of the BrAPI Data Warehouse?

You can find a live example at [BrAPI GUI](https://brapi-gui.zendro-dev.org/), which hosts a clone of [Cassavabase](https://www.cassavabase.org/) [1, 2]. This instance contains multi-omics data of the cassava plant, using the latest BrAPI (V2.1) data models.

The graphical user interface (GUI) is largely intuitive and self-explanatory. However, for your convenience, we have prepared a brief usage guide: [How to use Zendro’s graphical user interface](https://zendro-dev.github.io/usage/spa).

To explore the GraphQL server backend, use the following link: [BrAPI GraphQL](https://brapi-graphql.zendro-dev.org/graphql).

A comprehensive manual on the Zendro GraphQL API can be found here:  
- [Introduction to GraphQL and querying the API](https://zendro-dev.github.io/usage/graphql)  
- For developers: [Zendro GraphQL for developers](https://zendro-dev.github.io/api_root/graphql)  

For general information about GraphQL, please refer to the official [GraphQL documentation](https://graphql.org/).
