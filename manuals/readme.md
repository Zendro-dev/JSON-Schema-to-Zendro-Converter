## What can I find in this directory?

### Manuals

- In this directory, you will find manuals for setting up the BrAPI database supported by Zendro, including:

    - SQL  
    - MongoDB  
    - Cassandra  
    - Amazon S3  
    - Trino  
    - Presto  
    - Neo4j  

- A manual for obtaining the GraphQL schema of the models through the migrations managed by Zendro.  

- A manual for adjusting the models generated by the Zendro converter so that the models can be stored in different databases.  

### Output of zendro schema 

In [zendro_schema_output.graphql](https://github.com/Zendro-dev/Zendro-Converter/blob/main/manuals/zendro_schema_output.graphql), you will find the example file that Zendro will generate when you run the migration as indicated in the manual.


## BrAPI Data Warehouse  

In the **[brapi_data_warehouse](https://github.com/Zendro-dev/brapi_data_warehouse)** repository, we demonstrate how Zendro can be used to quickly set up a fully BrApi compliant data warehouse with multi Omics data. 

You will find the following folders:  

- **brapi_with_models**  
- **brapi_without_models**  
- **brapi_distibuted_models**

These already contain everything you need to set up a Zendro instance using the BrAPI V2.1 schema.  

For more details, please visit [this repository](https://github.com/Zendro-dev/brapi_data_warehouse).


## Where can I see an example of the BrAPI Data Warehouse?

You can find a live example at [BrAPI GUI](https://brapi-gui.zendro-dev.org/), which hosts a clone of [Cassavabase](https://www.cassavabase.org/) [1, 2]. This instance contains multi-omics data of the cassava plant, using the latest BrAPI (V2.1) data models.

The graphical user interface (GUI) is largely intuitive and self-explanatory. However, for your convenience, we have prepared a brief usage guide: [How to use Zendro’s graphical user interface](https://zendro-dev.github.io/usage/spa).

To explore the GraphQL server backend, use the following link: [BrAPI GraphQL](https://brapi-graphql.zendro-dev.org/graphql).

A comprehensive manual on the Zendro GraphQL API can be found here:  
- [Introduction to GraphQL and querying the API](https://zendro-dev.github.io/usage/graphql)  
- For developers: [Zendro GraphQL for developers](https://zendro-dev.github.io/api_root/graphql)  

For general information about GraphQL, please refer to the official [GraphQL documentation](https://graphql.org/).
